     * Project MKUltra was an illegal human experiments program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
     * to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken people and force confessions through
     * brainwashing and psychological torture. It began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate
     * its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD)
     * and other chemicals without the subjects' consent, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual
     * abuse, and other forms of torture.
     * MKUltra was preceded by Project Artichoke. It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated
     * with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. The program engaged in illegal activities, including the
     * use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects. MKUltra's scope was broad, with activities carried
     * out under the guise of research at more than 80 institutions aside from the military, including colleges and universities,
     * hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although some top officials at these
     * institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.
     * MKUltra was revealed to the public in 1975 by the Church Committee of the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States
     * President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States (the Rockefeller Commission). Investigative efforts were hampered
     * by CIA Director Richard Helms's order that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission
     * investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the small number of documents that survived Helms's order.
     * In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings.
     * Some surviving information about MKUltra was declassified in 2001.
